🧠 Professional Summary

I am a disciplined and growth-oriented software engineering student with a strong foundation in Java, Data Structures, SQL, and Web basics (HTML/CSS).
I focus on clear logic, clean code, and practical problem-solving rather than shallow tool-hopping.

I am currently seeking internship / fresher-level roles where I can contribute, learn fast, and grow as a backend-oriented developer.
